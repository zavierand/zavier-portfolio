# Portfolio Website
This is a very simple portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript. As a computer science student, I wanted to create a website that integrates the content learned in class with my other skills and hobbies of creating and designing.
My website resembles a simple terminal that is used heavily when compiling my projects, assignments, and all other sorts of shenanigans during the school year and in my free time.

## Features
The website is very simple. Users can type commands into the "console" to view and interact with the website. Instead of having different links to each page of the website, the commands bring up either a link or a small excerpt of text relating to the command that was typed in.

## Future Plans
Future plans for this website include to build the same website using React after the semester is over. Another is to integrate more commands into terminal - such as an option to play music from a playlist of my choosing.
